Branching Model:
https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

Tag: Depends 
	0.1 or 0.1.1 or 0.1.1.1
	

How to tag a project:

// Code synced from different branch with master then we tag the project

$ git tag			: tags details if present else need to tag
$ git branch		: cross check the branch before tagging
$ git tag -a “0.1”	: tag as “0.1” for the current project
$ git push origin --tags	: tag reflect in remote, check in release


// In Future whenever explains try to follow the below standard branch names:
Master: Default
Hotfix: Fix the Prod Bug
Release: Code fix and ready to push in Master to push in Prod
Develop: Developer generally works in this branch
Feature: Multiple developer create a feature branch, once done push into Develop branch for further process
