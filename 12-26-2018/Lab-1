GIT VS GITHUB:
Git is the tool, GitHub is the service for projects that use Git.

Git Repository:
A file location where you can store all the files related to your project.
When you Git commit your code, a version/snapshot is created in your local repo.
Remote repository: A remote repository generally lies somewhere outside your system, on a remote machine.

Branches:
A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits.
The default branch in GIT is master.
As you initially make commits, you’re given a master branch that points to the last commit you made.
Multiple branches pointing into the commit’s data history.

Features:
Git feature branch workflow is branching model focused, meaning that it is a guiding framework for managing and creating branches,
Th Git flow, and Git Forking workflows use a Git feature branch workflow in regards to their branching models

Local Repository:

Remote Repository:

Note:
Pull the recent changes from Remote repository.
Push the latest changes to Remote repository.


Git Life Cycle:
Suppose for an example you have created a branch and added one new file.

# Created a new branch from master and added some changes and push the changes

$ git clone <URL>						: Create a repository and clone to your local
$ git branch							: View the current branch
$ git checkout -b <new-branch-name>	: To create a new branch with any name
$ nano <file-name>					: nano is an editor, here we have created one file and added some content
$ cat <file-name>						: list the contents of new file
$ git status							: new file appears in red color which implies it’s an untracked file
$ git add . Or git add -A or git add <file-name>	: added the new changes into staging area
$ git status							: new file appears in green color which implies it’s an tracked file
$ git commit -m "Adding a new file"		: Added a valid message
$ git branch							: For cross verification
$ git push origin GitBasic				: Push the latest changes into Remote repository
