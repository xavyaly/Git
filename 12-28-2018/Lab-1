Lab-1:

GIT LIFE CYCLE WORKS AT THE BACKEND:

WORKING DIR -> CHANGES DONE -> ADD/REMOVE <-> STAGING AREA -> COMMIT CHANGES -> LOCAL REPO -> REMOTE REPOSITORY

# SYNC THE CODE FROM MASTER TO <ANY-BRANCH>

New Pull Requests:
$ git branch
$ touch <file-name>
$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -m “Added a test file”
$ git push origin <branch-name>		

Note:
The code in the specific branch or the branch in which you were working doesn’t sync with the master branch, 
So, you need to raise a Pull Request and communicate with your Manager to compare the code and push the changes into master

Go to Git UI:
Click on “New Pull Requests”
Cross check the base and compare branches
Add a valid msg: “Please sync the code for tag0.1”
Click on “Create Pull Request”

Note:
Till here DevOps Activity

Manager:
Click on “Merge pull requests”
Click on “Confirm merge”
# Note: Option to remove the remote branch totally depends upon your requirement
Add a valid msg: “Code conflicts resolves and merge into master”
Click on Comment
