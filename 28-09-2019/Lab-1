Lab-1:

Create a new branch
Push the same source as master from the new branch
	$ git branch				// master
	$ ls -l					// all contents of master
	$ git branch preprod		// prepared new branch created
	$ git checkout preprod		// switched to new branch
	$ ls -l					// all contents of master
	$ git add .
	$ git commit -m “same as master”	//
	$ git push origin preprod	// 
							// verify in UI

// Till here we have pushed the same source code as master

Create a new branch 
Did some changes and push the source code as per requirement into remote
	$ git branch
	$ ls -l
	$ git branch performance
	$ ls -l
	$ rm <any-file>				// removed the file which not required
	$ git add .
	$ git commit -m “removed unwanted files”
	$ git push origin performance	
							// verify in UI

// Till here we have created a new branch and start the activities as per our requirement

Note: In Real time
No one can do any changes in Master
We can pull at any moment from master but can’t push in master directly

Your Manager did some changes in master branch and pushed into remote

	$ git branch				// may be u were different branch
	$ git checkout master		// switched to master branch	
	$ rm <files>				// removed unwanted files
	$ touch <file-name>		// created a new called qualcomm and add some contents in a file
	$ git add .
	$ git commit -m “added a new file”
	$ git push origin master

// Till here we have added a file and push the changes into master

My requirement is:
Switched to any branch
Pull the recent changes from master
Push the changes to that specific branch to remote
	$ git branch						// master
	$ ls -l							// qualcomm a new has been created
	$ git checkout <branch-name>		// switched to any branch
	$ ls -l							// qualcomm file is missing; just for an example; or may be cross verify from UI
	$ git pull origin <branch-name>		// specify the branch from you want; example master you can take
	$ git push origin <branch-name>	//
									// verify in UI; example in performance branch

// Till here we have synced two branches like performance/<branch-name> and master
