GIT: 

Repository:	
Git repository is just a file location where you are storing all the files related to your project. ... When you git commit your code, a version/snapshot is created in your local repo. Remote repository: A remote repository generally lies somewhere outside your system, on a remote machine.

Branches:
A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branchname in Git is master. As you initially make commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. ... Multiple branches pointing into the commit's data history.

Features: 
Git Feature Branch Workflow is branching model focused, meaning that it is a guiding framework for managing and creating branches. ... The Gitflow, and GitForking Workflows traditionally use a Git Feature Branch Workflow in regards to their branching models.

Local Repository:

Remote Repository

Git Life Cycle:
Suppose for an example you have created a branch and added one file
$ git clone “URL”
$ git branch
$ git checkout -b “New_Branch_Name”
$ touch test
$ git status		# List the untracked files, appears in red color
$ git add test 	# If only one file changes
$ git add .		# If multiple files
$ git status		# List of tracked files, appears as green
$ git pull 		# Fetch out the changes done by different peoples
$ git commit -m “adding one new file”	# Committing the changes
$ git push 		# push the changes from Local to Remote
OR
$ git push origin branch_name
